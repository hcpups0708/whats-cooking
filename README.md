### Description: 

 generate the word type in the of token in ingredients

### Futher TODO: 
	
 choose the most frequent type of the token
	
### e.g.

 ``` json
 ..
 "chicken": {
 		"ADJ": 7, 
		"NOUN": 157, 
		"VERB": 18
	}, 
 },
 ..
 ```
	
 so "chicken" would catogorize as "NOUN"
	
 and then maybe try to remove all the verb or adj in ingredients
